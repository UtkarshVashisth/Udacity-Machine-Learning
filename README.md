# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
This repository contains the projects that are completed as a part of Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Basic Nanodegree.

## Projects
There are 2 projects in this repo:
1. [Finding Donors for Charity](https://github.com/UtkarshVashisth/Udacity-Machine-Learning/tree/master/finding_donors)<br/>
Helping a Charity Organization to identify those people who are most likely to donate for their cause. Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier(SVC) are compared to predict the likelihood of donation. Feature selection techniques are explored to optimize the model.
  
2. [Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning](https://github.com/UtkarshVashisth/Udacity-Machine-Learning/tree/master/customer_segments)<br/>
The aim is to identify different customer segments for better understanding of customer behaviours and formulate a strategy which will suffice the customer needs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Mixture Modeling(GMM) are explored.
